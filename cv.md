## About Me

I'm a recent graduate of Vocational High School with a specialization in Computer and Network Engineering (Class of 2023). My passion for IT, particularly Software Development, led me to pursue this field.

During my studies, I gained hands-on experience with Fiber Optics, Network Installation (LAN & WAN), and a basic understanding of IoT. Additionally, I've independently explored various programming languages like JAVA, C++, HTML, PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript.
